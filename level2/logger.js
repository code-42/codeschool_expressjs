// 2.7 Logging Middleware 240 pts

// Help finish the following middleware code in the logger.js file:
// Task 1/4 On the response object, listen to the event that's emitted when the response has been handed off from Express to the underlying Operating System. 
// Task 2/4 Inside of the finish callback, calculate the duration of the request by subtracting the startTime from a new Date object. Store the duration in the duration variable, which has already been declared for you.
// Task 3/4 Using the stream object, which holds a reference to standard out, write the following message: "This request took ____ ms", where ____ is the duration for the request.
// Task 4/4 If we run the code as is, the request will be stuck in our middleware. Call the function that moves processing to the next middleware in the stack.

module.exports = function (request, response, next) {
  var startTime = +new Date();
  var stream = process.stdout;
  var duration = null;

  response.on('finish', function () {
    duration = +new Date() - startTime;
    stream.write("This request took " + duration + " ms");
  });
  next();
  
};
